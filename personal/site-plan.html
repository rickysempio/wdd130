      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
      Hi everyone, I’m Ricky Martinez Sempio, from the Philippines. I am married and have 3 children. 
      My eldest son Elder Sempio is currently serving as a full-time missionary in Philippines Legaspi Mission, and 
      my other children are in their secondary education studying, and their mom takes care of them. 
      I love to follow NBA games, and love playing basketball. I love to read good books and watch news 
      like CNN and excited to know what’s happening around the world.
      </p>
      <p>I am currently pursuing an education in BYU-Idaho through online in Applied Technology. 
      I believe that education and learning is a continuous process in life, and Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley said:
       “Education is the key to opportunity”.</p>

      <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints since I was young, and
      was also able to serve as full-time missionary, and met people in all walks of life, and been to 
      some callings in the church.</p>

      <p>One of my favourite scriptures is found on “1 Nephi 2:4 And it came to pass that he departed into 
      the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 
      his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and 
      departed into the wilderness.” I believe that our family is the source of our happiness and inspiration.</p>
      <p>I am currently working with Itech Vision as IT Onsite Engineer, Supporting devices from all leading brands 
      such as PCs, Laptops and Printers (HP, Lexmark and other brands). </p>

      <p>I have increased operation productivity by 10% by efficiently training and assigning service tickets 
      calls to Onsite technicians. Managed to closed service tickets calls by 90% by assisting in trouble shooting and 
      isolating escalated issues. I was commended by our client for efficiently implementing the service level 
      agreement minimizing downtime in their operations.</p>
