    <h2>Ricky Martinez Sempio</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, I’m Ricky Martinez Sempio, from the Philippines. I am married 
    and have 3 children.My eldest son Elder Sempio is currently serving as a full 
    time missionary in Philippines Legaspi Mission, and my other children are still 
    studying and their mom takes care of them. I love to follow NBA games,and love 
    playing basketball. I am pursuing an education in BYU-Idaho through online 
    in Applied technology.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints 
    since I was young,and was also able to serve as full-time missionary and been 
    to some callings in the church. </p>
    <p>One of my favourite scriptures is found on “1 Nephi 2:4 And it came to 
    pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 
    of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and 
    took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and 
    departed into the wilderness.”</p>
